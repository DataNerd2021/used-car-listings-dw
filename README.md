MVP:
- A containerized application that utilizes Airbyte to connect data from disparate sources, Airflow to run a batch data pull from the Auto.dev API and load the raw JSON into a PostgreSQL instance.
- Use dbt to create a Medallion Architecture for Data Quality, Documentation, and Semantic Layer.
- Use dbt to create a Dimensional Model including SCDs and Conformed Dimensions as needed.
- Use duckdb as data warehouse.

Tools:
- Docker
- Airbyte
- Airflow
